# About this site
This website is a collection of structured notes on optics and photonics.
It is not intended to be a complete or systematic textbook. Instead, it focuses on specific topics that may lack clear, concise, or accessible explanations in existing literature.
The content reflects areas the author has explored in the course of research or personal interest. Special attention is given to polarization phenomena, fiber optics, and the Poincar√© sphere method.
Where appropriate, interactive visualizations and diagrams are included to support understanding.
Welcome!
