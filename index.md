This website is a growing collection of more or less structured notes on optics and photonics.
It is not intended as a complete or systematic textbook. Instead, it focuses on specific topics that are often overlooked or poorly explained in existing literature — or considered too “obvious” within the professional community.

Special attention is given to visual aids, particularly to the Poincaré sphere method for illustrating polarization-related effects.
The content largely reflects the author's personal interests, with an emphasis on fiber optics, polarization phenomena, and interferometry.
